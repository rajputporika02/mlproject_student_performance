# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting students’ math scores based on various demographic and academic features. The dataset includes attributes such as gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch type, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. The primary goal is to build an end-to-end machine learning pipeline that handles data ingestion, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to understand the data distribution, detect patterns, and identify potential correlations between features and the target variable. Categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding, while numerical features were standardized to improve model performance. Multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, K-Neighbors, and Decision Trees, were trained and evaluated. Metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and R² were used to assess the model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to optimize each model and identify the best-performing estimator. The Ridge Regression model initially provided the best baseline performance with a test R² of 0.88. The final pipeline was modularized into data ingestion, transformation, and model training components to ensure scalability and reproducibility. The trained model was then deployed using a Flask web application, allowing users to input student data and receive real-time predictions. Additionally, the application was integrated with Streamlit for a more interactive user interface. Logging and exception handling were incorporated throughout the pipeline to enhance reliability and traceability. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow, from data preprocessing to deployment, highlighting practical skills in machine learning, predictive modeling, and web integration. This repository can be extended to predict scores in other subjects or incorporate additional student-related features for more comprehensive performance analysis.
